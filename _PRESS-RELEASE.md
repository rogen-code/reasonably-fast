There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Run For Your Life

## Sub-Heading ##
  An app targeting folks who don't currently run but want to get into the game.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  This app 'suggests' a training plan for runners and tracks whether or not they are following the plan by connecting to the Strava API. The user plugs in a goal race date and the app automatically creates a "basic plan" for the user to follow. In later versions, I will likely add "levels" for the runner.

## Problem ##

  Many people want to get started running, but they don't know how to do it themselves. Or, they get started, run way too hard, and get hurt immediately. This app offers a glided approach to running with a target race data and reminders on what to do. It also offers accountability for folks who need to "check off" meeitng their running goal.


## Solution ##
  -- Creates a running plan based on a target marathon race data.
  -- Renders the running plan to a calendar.
  -- Connects to the Strava API and checks to see if the running activity was completed for the day.
  -- Renders green / red for days that were completed.

## Quote from You ##
  "If you want to get into fitness, this is for you!"

## How to Get Started ##
  -- Go to the website and log in with your favorite fitness application.
  -- Set a target data for your race.
  -- (Maybe: give us a bit of information about your running history)
  -- Provide your virtual coach with a bit of feedback each day...

## Customer Quote ##
  - "I didn't even know how to run before, and now I'm dominating Kipchoge."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  -- Go to the app. Plug in. Go for a run.
